= heredoc_unindent

* https://github.com/adrianomitre/heredoc_unindent

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem removes common margin from indented strings, such as the ones
produced by indented heredocs. In other words, it strips out leading whitespace
chars at the beggining of each line, but only as much as the line with the
smallest margin.

It is acknowledged that many strings defined by heredocs are just code and fact
is that most parsers are insensitive to indentation. If, however, the strings
are to be used otherwise, be it for printing or testing, the extra indentation
will probably be an issue and hence this gem.

== SYNOPSIS:

  if true
    s = <<-EOS
      How sad it is
        to be unable
      to unindent heredocs
    EOS
    t = <<-EOS.unindent
      How wonderful it is
        to be able
      to do it!
    EOS
  end

  s[0..12]  #=>  "      How sad"
  t[0..12]  #=>  "How wonderful"

  s = "   foo"  #=>  "   foo"
  s.unindent!   #=>  "foo"
  s.unindent!   #=>  nil
  s             #=>  "foo"

  u = "  1\n \n\n"
  u.unindent == u #=> true
  u.unindent(ignore_empty: true) #=> " 1\n\n\n"
  u.unindent(ignore_blank: true) #=> "1\n\n\n"

This task will install any missing dependencies, run the tests/specs,
and generate the RDoc.

== ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The initial implementation was based on the answer by Rene Saarsoo to the question
{how do i remove leading whitespace chars from ruby heredoc}[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3772864/how-do-i-remove-leading-whitespace-chars-from-ruby-heredoc].

== ALTERNATIVES

Despite minor API differences or edge-case behaviour, the following gems
implement equivalent unindenting functionality:

1. {outdent}[http://rubygems.org/gems/outdent] (formerly {unindentable}[http://rubygems.org/gems/unindentable])
2. {unindent}[http://rubygems.org/gems/unindent]
3. {indentation}[http://rubygems.org/gems/indentation] -- this gem has a broader scope, in addition to String#reset_indentation

=== So why another one?

Well, the fact is that the author only found about the other gems after he had
already implemented the initial version of heredoc_unindent. And it was for the
good, as benchmarking revealed that heredoc_unindent is by far the most
efficient of them, both memory and processor-wise.

=== Efficiency!

Depending on the Ruby implementation, heredoc_unindent is is about *1.6--2.4x*
*faster* than {unindent}[http://rubygems.org/gems/unindent], *1.9--6.6x*
*faster* than {indentation}[http://rubygems.org/gems/indentation],
and *4--19x* *faster* than {outdent}[http://rubygems.org/gems/outdent].
In addition, heredoc_unindent has the *lowest* *memory* *consumption*,
requiring only between a fifth and a sixth of the competitors.
